Welcome to Pypgen (v0.1)
-----------------------

This is repository contains a python classes for parsing genepop files calculating *Gst*, *G'st*, *G''st*, *D*, and the 'estimators' of each of these diversity measures. This code is a rewrite of my SMOGD code.  Although there are only minimal changes to the functionality, at this time, the code is considerably more 

### Up Next ###

1.) Currently each diversity measure is calculated from the raw genotypes each time its calculator function is called. This is slow. In the future I'll add code to store the relevant intermediate steps which should speed thing up considerably.

2.) The pairwise calculators and bootstrapping analysis didn't make this version.

3.) One of the main goals of this rewrite is to provide commandline tools.  I'll be producing a command line version of shortly.
